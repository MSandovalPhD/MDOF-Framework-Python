# Multiple Degrees-Of-Freedom Input Devices for Interactive Command and Control within Virtual Reality in Industrial Visualisations
LISU (which stands for Layered Interaction System for User-Modes) is a framework developed for managing the raw input data from heterogeneous input devices. LISU offers a solution for VR (Virtual Reality) developers, creators, and designers to resolve interoperability and compatibility issues in VR applications caused by the heterogeneity of input controllers by unifying the roles of multiple code segments and APIs for input management.
